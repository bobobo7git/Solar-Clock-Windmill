# Solar & Clock & Windmill

<b>1. Solar System</b>
- the solar system containing the sun, venus, earth, moon, saturn, and the Titan
- tried to use real images, the size is exaggerated though
- the distance each planet and moons is also exaggerated or understated
- the orbit rotation period is applied which is in real world
